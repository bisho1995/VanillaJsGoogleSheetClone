Movie Analysis
[Problem Statement]

Develop a pseudo frontend web app for Movie Analysis. Your web app should display an Excel sheet type of grid on the UI, where certain columns should provide filter functionality.


[Tasks]

Basic:

— Use of web API to fetch movie details.

— Implement an Excel sheet like grid on the UI, listing all the movie details.

— Implement pagination on the UI. Show only 10 records at a time and allow users to go back and forth.

 

Advanced:

— Grid columns should provide sort and filter like excel sheet.

Columns [genres, language, country, budget, title_year] should provide sort and filter.

— Dark - Light theme. Implement a Dark - Light theme in your web app and allow users to toggle between them.

— The filtering should be implemented for each individual column, and as someone types or chooses from a dropdown, the table or grid below dynamically shows the matching records.

— If time permits, use your creativity and implement features which would make your web app user friendly.
